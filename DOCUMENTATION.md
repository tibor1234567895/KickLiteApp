# Kick Live Streaming App Documentation

## Project Overview
A React Native mobile application built with Expo that allows users to watch live streams from Kick.com by entering a username.

## Technical Requirements
- Built with Expo
- Uses Kick.com API v2
- Video player integration for live streaming
- Username-based stream lookup

## Dependencies
- expo-av (for video playback)
- axios (for API requests)
- @react-navigation/native (already installed)
- @react-navigation/stack (already installed)
- nativewind (already installed)

## API Endpoints
- Stream Info: `https://kick.com/api/v2/channels/{username}`

## Project Structure
1. Core Features
   - Username input interface
   - API integration for stream data
   - Video player implementation
   - Stream information display

2. Data Model (from API)
   - Channel information
   - Stream details
   - Playback URL
   - User details

3. Project Files Structure

## Implementation Steps
1. [x] Initial project setup with Expo
2. [x] Install additional dependencies
3. [x] Create project structure
4. [x] Create basic UI components
5. [x] Implement API integration
6. [x] Add video player functionality
7. [ ] Test and debug
8. [ ] Style and polish UI

## Progress Tracking

### Completed Tasks
- Initial documentation created
- Basic Expo project setup with navigation
- Created project structure
- Implemented HomeScreen with username input
- Implemented StreamScreen with video player
- Added API integration for fetching stream data
- Set up navigation flow

### In Progress
- Testing and debugging
- UI polish and styling improvements

### Pending Tasks
- Test on different devices
- Add error handling improvements
- Add loading states and animations
- Polish UI/UX

## Notes
- Example API response stored in example.json
- Need to handle video playback using m3u8 stream URL
- Must consider error handling for invalid usernames or offline streams
- Using TypeScript for better type safety and development experience

## Usage
1. Start the app
2. Enter a Kick.com username in the input field
3. Press "Watch Stream" to view the live stream
4. The stream will automatically play if the channel is live

## Known Issues
- Need to test video playback on different devices
- Need to verify error handling for all edge cases

## Manual QA
- **Refresh failure preserves login error:** With a signed-in session, force the `/refresh` proxy endpoint to respond with an error (for example by stopping the proxy or returning HTTP 500). Trigger a token refresh (e.g., wait until expiry or invoke the refresh function). After the refresh failure, confirm that the Login screen displays the error message explaining the failure while the user is signed out.
- **Kick OAuth happy path:** Start a fresh sign-in, observe the generated Kick consent screen, approve access, and confirm that the app signs in successfully without error once Kick redirects back.
- **Kick OAuth state mismatch aborts sign-in:** Initiate sign-in, and before completing the Kick flow manually tamper with the returned `state` (for example by intercepting the redirect URI or modifying the response in the proxy). Confirm that sign-in is aborted, no tokens are stored, and the app displays an authentication error.
