## Environment Configuration

| Variable | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_TYPESENSE_SEARCH_KEY` | Read-only Typesense search key used for local development builds. Required for the search screen. |

Create a `.env` file (or configure your preferred secrets manager) and export the variable before starting Expo:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_TYPESENSE_SEARCH_KEY=your_typesense_search_key_here
```

If the variable is missing the app will surface an informative error. This prevents accidentally running a build with a compromised or undefined key.

## API Integration

The app uses the following Kick.com API endpoints:

- Channel Info: `https://kick.com/api/v2/channels/{username}`
- Live Streams: `https://kick.com/stream/livestreams/tr`
- Search: `https://search.kick.com/multi_search`

For production builds, proxy search requests through a secure backend (e.g., a serverless function or API gateway) so the mobile app never bundles private Typesense keys. After moving the key server-side, regenerate the compromised search key in Typesense and store only the new server-side credential.
